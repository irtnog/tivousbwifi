tivownet_loadfw
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tivousbwifi/

Load firmware to TiVo USB Wireless Adapter.

Generically, should be able to load firmware to the Broadcom chip
    BCM4320
    AirForce One. Single-Chip 802.11g USB 2.0 Transceiver

Overview
========
This release is to provide an user mode utility to load firmware onto the
TiVo Wireless USB Adapter.  It may be of value to others as the adapter is
based on the Broadcom BCM4320 chipset.  It demonstrates the protocol between
the chip and host for firmware download.

The tivownetusb device driver contains the necessary support for firmware
download and therefore this utility is not necessary.

This utility is being release for development research and demonstration
purposes.

Operation
=========
1. Plug in the TiVo Wireless USB adapter into the host.
2. cat /proc/bus/usb/devices and you should see the device as it was
   enumerated.

   T:  Bus=04 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=05 Cnt=01 Dev#= 48 Spd=480 MxCh= 0
   D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
   P:  Vendor=0a5c ProdID=bd11 Rev= 0.01
   S:  Manufacturer=Broadcom
   S:  Product=Remote Download Wireless Adapter
   S:  SerialNumber=000000000001
   C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=200mA
   I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=02 Prot=ff Driver=(none)
   E:  Ad=01(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 512 Ivl=0ms

3. Execute tivownet_loadfw to load the firmware.
   (you can execute tivownet_loadfw --help for command line options)
4. cat /proc/bus/usb/devices and you should see the new device as it was
   enumerated.

   T:  Bus=04 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=05 Cnt=01 Dev#= 47 Spd=480 MxCh= 0
   D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=02(comm.) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
   P:  Vendor=150a ProdID=1010 Rev= 0.06
   S:  Manufacturer=Broadcom
   S:  Product=USBCDC 802.11 Wireless Adapter
   S:  SerialNumber=############
   C:* #Ifs= 2 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=100mA
   I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=02(comm.) Sub=02 Prot=ff Driver=(none)
   E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=  16 Ivl=1ms
   I:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=0a(data ) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=(none)
   E:  Ad=82(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 512 Ivl=0ms
   E:  Ad=03(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 512 Ivl=125us

5. optionally, you can execute tivownet_loadfw again, it should not find the
   device, as it only looks for VID 0x0a5c and PID 0xbd11.  The loader does
   not attempt to go back through the devices on the bus to determine if the
   firmware load and subsequent reboot of the device was successful (this
   feature may be added at a later date).
